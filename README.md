#Data Structures Assignments 1st Half
####Jesse Klein & Muoi Ly


###Queue Data Structures Assignment
Access 'queue.py' for the class Queue and create a queue to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_queue.py'.


###Linked List Assignment
Use LinkedList class from link_list.py to implement a singly linked list


###Stack Assignment
Use Stack class from stack.py to implement the class and its methods, push(value) and pop(). The Stack class inherets methods from LinkedList using composition. We referred to Learn Python the Hard Way for implementing composition: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex44.html


###Doubly Linked List Data Structures Assignment
Access 'dll.py' for the class Dll and create a doubly linked list to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_dll.py'.


###Binary Heap Data Structures Assignment
Access 'binheap.py' for the class Binheap and create a doubly linked list to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_binheap.py'.


###Priority Queue Data Structures Assignment
Access 'priorityq.py' for the class PriorityQ and create a doubly linked list to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_priorityq.py'. This assignment heavily uses code from
the previous binary heap assignment.


###Simple Graph Assignment
Access 'simple_graph.py' for the class G and create a graph object to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_simple_graph.py'. This assignment heavily uses code from
the previous binary heap assignment. Thanks to Martin Broadhurst for a great resource. http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/graph-data-structures.html


#Data Structures Assignments 2nd Half
####Jesse Klein & Saki Fu


###Binary Search Tree
Access 'bst.py' for the class Node and create a binary search tree. The test
file for the module is 'test_bst.py'. We referred to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) and [SmCaterpillar](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29379213/depth-of-a-binary-search-tree-in-python) on Stack Overflow.


###Binary Search Tree Traversals
Access 'bst.py' for the class Node and create a binary search tree with traversal methods. The test file for the module is 'test_bst.py'. We referred to Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal).


###Binary Search Tree Delete()
Access 'bst.py' for the class Node and create a binary search tree with a delete() method. The test file for the module is 'test_bst.py'. We referred to Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree).


###Binary Search Tree Rebalance()
Access 'bst.py' for the class Node and create a binary search tree with a rebalance() method. The test file for the module is 'test_bst.py'. We referred to Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_rotation) for tree rotation and used their conventions for test cases.


###Hash Table
Access 'hash.py' for the class Hash and create a hash table. The test file for the module is 'test_hash.py'. The hashing algorithm used was the sum of character ord() values mod number of buckets. We referred to *Learn Python the Hard Way* [here](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html).


###Insertion Sort
Access 'insertion.py' for the function insertion_sort() to sort a list in place. The test file for the module is 'test_insertion.py'. We referred to *Interactive Python* [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheInsertionSort.html).
