###Queue Data Structures Assignment
Access 'queue.py' for the class Queue and create a queue to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_queue.py'.


###Linked List Assignment
Use LinkedList class from link_list.py to implement a singly linked list


###Stack Assignment
Use Stack class from stack.py to implement the class and its methods, push(value) and pop(). The Stack class inherets methods from LinkedList using composition. We referred to Learn Python the Hard Way for implementing composition: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex44.html


###Doubly Linked List Data Structures Assignment
Access 'dll.py' for the class Dll and create a doubly linked list to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_dll.py'.


###Binary Heap Data Structures Assignment
Access 'binheap.py' for the class Binheap and create a doubly linked list to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_binheap.py'.


###Priority Queue Data Structures Assignment
Access 'priorityq.py' for the class PriorityQ and create a doubly linked list to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_priorityq.py'. This assignment heavily uses code from
the previous binary heap assignment.


###Simple Graph Assignment
Access 'simple_graph.py' for the class G and create a graph object to hold data.
The test file for the module is 'test_simple_graph.py'. This assignment heavily uses code from
the previous binary heap assignment. Thanks to Martin Broadhurst for a great resource. http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/graph-data-structures.html

###Binary Search Tree
Access 'bst.py' for the class Node and create a binary search tree. The test
file for the module is 'test_bst.py'. We referred to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) and [SmCaterpillar](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29379213/depth-of-a-binary-search-tree-in-python) on Stack Overflow.
