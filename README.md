####Jesse Klein


Within 'proper_parens.py' access proper_parens(str) to test for balanced parenthises.

The function will:

Return 1 if the string is "open" (there are open parens that are not closed)
Return 0 if the string is "balanced" (there are an equal number of open and closed parentheses in the string)
Return -1 if the string is "broken" (a closing parens has not been proceeded by one that opens)
